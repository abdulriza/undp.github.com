Over the past decades, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
and the Government of Japan have developed an important partnership,
anchored in the belief that without peace, security and stability in the Arab
region, the advancement of human well-being cannot be achieved. Together,
we have worked to ensure a balanced approach to better the livelihoods of men, women and children in the Arab states.

In 2013, UNDP and the Government of Japan marked two decades of cooperation to promote development in Africa through the Tokyo International Conference for African Development (TICAD). Nine UNDP offices in the Arab region are located in Africa and have benefited from this partnership.
